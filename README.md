### Project Presentation

Hello there! Welcome to my 2048 Game project, a testament to my JavaScript proficiency. Let me walk you through the exciting features and challenges that this project encapsulates. [this reference](https://denys2.github.io/Portfolio-2048/)

##Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic 2048 game, showcasing my adeptness in JavaScript. The game adheres to specific rules and requirements, providing a challenging yet enjoyable experience for users.

#Project Features
1. Game Mechanics
The game field is a 4x4 grid.
Cells may contain numbers: 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^n.
Players move cells using keyboard arrows.
Numbers merge when two equal cells meet, doubling the value.
Merged cells cannot merge again in the same move.
2. Gameplay Elements
Valid moves fill empty cells.
After each move, a 2 or 4 appears randomly in an empty cell.
A win message displays when the player reaches the coveted 2048 value.
The game over message appears when no more moves are available.
3. User Interface
The start message hides upon game initiation.
The Start button transforms into Restart after the first move.
Score increments with each move, totaling the sum of merged cells.
4. Visual Enhancements
Styling utilizes the field-cell--%cell_value% class for visual appeal.
Elements are strategically hidden using the hidden class.
The main button features distinct styles with start and restart classes.
